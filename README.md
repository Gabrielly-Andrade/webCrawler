Python Web Crawler: Using Selenium
============================

## About

The main objective of this project is to create a crawler who could extract the title, name and url of all the products in this website:  http://www.epocacosmeticos.com.br/. 
  
## Installation

    I'm trying to use docker for this. More info will appear as soon as possible.

1- Clone this repository

2- Install docker using this website

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms

    Open your terminal and test your docker version using this command

    docker --version

    If you get the docker version as an output, you are ready to move to the next step. Otherwise, try to search to some tutorials on youtube.
